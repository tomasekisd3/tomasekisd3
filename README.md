👋 Hi, I’m @tomasekisd3, my name is Tomás Ortiz. Chile is the place where i live in.

👀 I have a computer engineering degree with BI and ML specializations, as you can imagine my title project is related to those areas, specifically Machine Learning. 
   My project was the development and analysis of a machine learning algorithm to classify retinal fundus images. I was very excited working on that project, I learned
   too many things, the best part was when the code compiled, I said 'It works!'.
   
🌱 At the present time I've worked as a Software Engineer, i prefer the backend development more than the frontend that it is not my specialty.

💞️ I love to play guitar!
